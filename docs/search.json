The stress distributions are remarkably similar across all attendance categories, and the statistical tests confirm that any observed differences are not significant. This suggests that other factors may be more important in determining student stress levels than attendance patterns."

While higher technical degrees tend to command higher salaries, the relationship isn’t statistically significant 2. There’s considerable overlap in salary ranges across different education levels 3. Technical and professional degrees show more salary stability 4. Education alone isn’t the sole determinant of IT salaries in India"
